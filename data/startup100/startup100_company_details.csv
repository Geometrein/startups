Buddy Healthcare is on a mission to transform care coordination in hospitals and clinics by making care accessible and measurable for everyone, everywhere and anytime.

BuddyCare App for Patients

The BuddyCare App provides patients with all the information they need to navigate throughout the care process. It automates the whole workflow, communication, instructions, forms, and reminders so that patients are always aware of the next steps on the care path.

The App is customized based on the needs of the care provider so that it's always perfectly in-line with the patient processes and workflows. A white label application is available with rapid delivery time for those care providers, who wish to have their own branded application.

BuddyCare Dashboard for Care Personnel

Through the BuddyCare Dashboard, care personnel has real-time visibility over patients’ preparation and recovery activities. The tool is used to collect, analyze and visualize patient data, which allows care personnel to focus on those patients most in need of attention. The system also uses data analytics to early predict risks for surgery no shows, and to find evidence-based best practices for patient pathways to improve quality of care.

Our innovative Kontrox(tm) technology achieves up to 98 % reduction of interface defect state density compared to the industry's standard method. This results in a significant boost in efficiency and an increase in the manufacturing yield of devices.

Comptek Solutions specializes in III-V compound semiconductor quantum surface engineering. Our patented Kontrox(tm) process enables a reduction of the surface defect density to unprecedented levels, thus resulting in a boost of efficiency and an increase in manufacturing yield of III-V semiconductor-based devices, such as Radio Frequency and Optoelectronic devices among others.

Direct benefits obtained with Kontrox(tm) are higher gate voltages, better quantum efficiency and lower leak currents. The novel crystalline structures formed on Kontrox(tm) treated surfaces are totally inert to ambient air, therefore additional passivation processes are no longer needed. In addition to this, the implementation of Kontrox(tm) into current manufacturing steps (e.g.epitaxy growth in MBE reactors) is simple and does not require extensive equipment modifications.

A new era in CPU performance has become a necessity in order to meet the continuously-increasing demand for more computing performance (driven to large extent by needs in AI, edge and cloud computing). Flow intends to enable this revolution through its Parallel Performance Unit (PPU), giving up to 100X the performance of any CPU, regardless of architecture. Our technology has full backwards software compatibility and it gives 2x performance improvement to most legacy applications after recompilation.

* Efficient editors help you create mathematical content (intuitively, quickly and a lot neater than pen and paper)
* Interactive eMath textbooks teach you High School Math in class or as supporting material. The e-books are based on the Structured Derivations -teaching method and the Finnish National Math Curriculum
* And eMathStudio, a learning environment, that keeps your STEM lesson material organized and easily accessible and editable. Submission of assignments, statistics and rapid individual feedback directly in assignments is supported.

Four Ferries is founded by teachers in STEM subjects, with the mission to improve math education. 

We all know that math is interesting and engaging, as long as we understand it.  When we don’t, we need help. But the feedback loop in today’s math education is broken: students work on their math problems, but don’t get proper feedback on their own solutions. Rather, they are shown model solutions in class, and are supposed to spot the errors in their own solutions from these. Some can do this, but many will fail and keep repeating the same errors in subsequent homework, until they drop out because they just don’t get it. Teachers could help, but there is no time to give individual feedback and tutoring to all students in the class.

The 4f tools are designed to fix that broken feedback loop. The teaching method, Structured Derivations, improves the way mathematical arguments are explained, so that it is easier to see the structure of the argument and understand the reasoning involved. Together, they will keep that love for math alive that all first graders show, all through life. And for us who are adults?

Laurantis Pharma,https://startup100.net/company/laurantis-pharma,"Herantis focuses on disease modifying, CDNF-based therapies for Parkinson’s disease that aim to restore proteostasis, body’s natural neuronal protective mechanism. A failure in proteostasis results in pathological accumulation of protein aggregates, neuroinflammation and various forms of cellular stress that is widely implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. CDNF is a protein that occurs naturally in the body. Its role is to protect neurons by balancing proteostasis, thereby preventing and counteracting disease generating mechanisms.

Herantis' molecules in development are CDNF-based; HER-096 (a synthetic peptide) and rhCDNF (a biological protein). HER-096 and rhCDNF have both demonstrated to have a multimodal mechanism of action mimicking CDNF and to improve functional recovery of damaged neurons in preclinical models. Importantly, HER-096 has been shown to readily penetrate the blood brain barrier allowing for convenient subcutaneous dosing. Thanks to their multimodal mechanism of action, Herantis’ molecules have the potential to stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease and significantly improve patients’ quality of life.

The connection of the intelligent sensor takes place without changing the mechanical meter and without touching the meter sealed by the water department.

LIG,https://startup100.net/company/lig,"Learning Intelligence Group is a leading education technology (edtech) pioneer in the Nordic region. We select, fund and grow edtech innovations from the Nordic region into profitable global brands. Born from decades of combined experience in building and funding edtech companies, LIG consists of experienced entrepreneurs and investors who leverage their resources, networks and funds to other entrepreneurs looking to aggressively innovate the undisrupted global education market.

The LIG story begins in 2013 in Helsinki, when entrepreneurs Vesa Perälä and Mervi Palander, first founded CLANED, a revolutionary cloud-based social learning environment. Their 4-year journey in making CLANED a success story revealed how edtech companies in the Nordic region lack the funding, business development support and networks to enable their success. 

The next major step in LIG story took place this year when LIG acquired GraphoGame, a research-driven literacy game and learning environment, to leverage the founders’ experience and networks in building Nordic edtech phenomena. So the LIG journey is moving forward with carefully selected companies and partners. 

Our vision is to become the world’s leading edtech business development group, enabling global success for the top entrepreneurs and technologies from the Nordic region. The LIG mission is to provide our portfolio businesses with an integrated support system through funding, mentoring and partner network exposure, while simultaneously fostering the nascent edtech ecosystem.

The Learning Intelligence team is a diverse mix of highly experienced entrepreneurs, executives, advisors and investors. Collectively they boast:
+10 exits
+900M€ raised in funding
+100 years of entrepreneurial experience
+50 years of corporate experience
Board members in 30 companies
C-level positions at world leading companies, such as IKEA, Stora Enso, GN Netcom, Coloplast
Board members of multinationals, such as Amer Sports, Novo Nordisk, Neste and Citi Group

Our browser version is similar to the mobile application with the exception of gps data. However a browser version allows for easier sharing and linking through other channels without the need to install any application.

2) Selling only pre-worn clothes that were sustainably produced already as new
So only from high-quality kids' brands such as Patagonia, Veja, Mini Rodini or Mainio.
3) Carbon negative
As a business model and as our basic functions are concerned, Ninyes emits very little to start with. The rest we overcomenpensate with the Gold Standard system.
We are just in the beginning of the journey of Ninyes and very eager to develop this further. And if you have smaller kids, submit some preworn clothes to be sold or buy some.

We founded Parkly to fast-track the transformation of public places and to accelerate sustainable urban change. We believe that happy places and happy people go hand in hand. 

Modular, circular and smart:
Parkly transforms public places with a modular, scalable solution, by creating a platform for hanging out and enjoying the urban greenscape. Parkly modules are easy to mix and match, scale up and down, and use in different locations. 

Placemaking as a service:
Parkly creates places where people can sit down, relax, and meet others. Whether a public square, parklet, office space or residential yard - great public places connect people. Parkly offers an easy alternative to slow and expensive renovations. It is a great tool for experiments too. Our services range from urban gardening workshops to green care, and are designed to pump life into the place. Parkly is also a great platform for community-driven activities. 

More urban green:
The green Parkly modules provide more biodiversity with pollinator friendly plants, more edible experiences with urban gardening boxes, and more trees to public places. 
 
Platform for co-creation: 
We are building up the module catalogue with a co-creation model and offer custom designs too. Parkly is a tool for making participation easy and visible for participants and planners alike. Together with our collaborators we offer services ranging from workshops, green care, maintenance, planning and consultation, and data collecting.

Circular at heart:
Parkly is created with sustainability at its core. It is part of the circular economy striving for the wise use of resources, and long life cycles. Our goal for Parkly is to pave the way for the green transition in cities by making the transformation of public places easy and inspiring.

It takes around 11 000 litres of unpolluted water to grow 1 kilogram of cotton. That means a single t-shirt requires as much as 2700 litres of water. 

Cotton clothing producers waste about 15% of the raw material. We don't make our products from virgin material. Instead, Pure Waste recycles the offcuts and spinning waste from clothing and textile industries. The raw material is collected, sorted by colour and quality, and mechanically opened back into the fibre. Then we mix it with recycled polyester or viscose and spin it into new yarns.

Find out more: https://rester.fi/en/

Finland, like other countries, generates huge amounts of textile waste. An estimated amount of 350 million kg of used textiles are disposed, as waste annually in the Nordic region. Finland’s share of this is around 100 million kg, of which about 80% is incinerated at the end of it’s life-cycle. This amount includes textiles used by both consumers and businesses. An EU directive, to be transposed into Finnish law as the new 2025 Waste Act, will oblige municipalities to set up and organise the collection of domestic used textiles. This in order to boost the quality of secondary raw material and its uptake. 

The circular economy facility being built by Rester Oy in Paimio aims to ensure that businesses can dispose their end of life cycle textiles sustain-ably. The facility will focus on producing new raw material from used textiles with an annual capacity of 6,000 tonnes. Time-frame for the completion of this high-tech facility is Q1/2021.

Tornion Panimo on käsityöläispanimo, joka toimii edelleen samoilla sijoilla, mihin panimo rakennettiin jo vuonna 1873. Panimomme alla ovat alkuperäiset, 140 vuotta vanhat kellariholvit, jotka saavat pian uuden elämän viskikellareina. Viskeistä ja muista viinoista voit lukea lisää kohdasta Tislaamo.

Vielä vuonna 2010 täällä tehtailtiin Lapin Kultaa yli 200 miljoonan litran vuosikapasiteetilla. Suurteollisuuden väistyttyä palautimme legendaarisen panimon juurilleen käsityöläispanimoksi. Panemme tällä hetkellä olutta käsityöläislaitteistolla, jonka keittokoko on 1000 litraa ja vuosikapasiteetti 200 000 litraa. Teemme siis vähän, mutta sitäkin parempaa olutta.

Maaliskuussa 2017 aloitamme uuden panimolaitteiston asennuksen. Aidosta Tornion teräksestä rakennettu laitteisto kasvattaa kokonaiskapasiteettimme lähelle 2,5 miljoonaa litraa vuodessa. 

Kasvaa pitää, jotta yhä useammat pääsevät nauttimaan aitoa Lapin olutta. Kerran suuren nähtyämme kuitenkin ymmärrämme, että olut on parhaimmillaan, kun sen tekevät pienet ihmiset suurella sydämellä. Pysymme siis jatkossakin leppoisina lappilaisina käsityöläisinä. 

Kaikki tuotteemme ja reseptimme kehitetään emoyhtiömme Sangenin laboratoriossa, missä touhuavat todelliset tieteen ja juomataiteen propellipäät. Laatumme on siis takuulla testattua ja kaikenlaista uutta kokeillaan jatkuvasti. 

Seuraavan kerran kun näet komean tornilogomme, tartu siihen ja nauti. Lapin reissuillasi suosittelemme poikkeamaan panimollamme. Järjestämme ryhmille tilauksesta panimokierroksia ja olutmaistajaisia.",2015,Other Consumer Technology,Tornio,http://www.sangen.fi/,"{'twitter': 'https://twitter.com/sangen_oy', 'facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/sangen.fi', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/10219151'}",2698589-9,https://www.finder.fi/search?what=2698589-9&type=company

The TILT approach has the potential to achieve similar results in CAR-T therapy of solid tumors as currently achieved for CD19+ hematological tumors.

TILT was founded by Pr. Akseli Hemminki, who has published hundreds of papers in the field and treated almost 300 patients with 10 different oncolytic viruses. In 2013 Pr. Hemminki started his second company, TILT Biotherapeutics, which technology is based on his past findings in the lab, and more importantly in the clinic. The research conducted by TILT alone or in collaboration with some of world’s leading research groups with synergic technologies has generated very good results. The lead candidate is a clinical stage TNFα/IL2 armed oncolytic adenovirus (TILT-123 or Ad5/3-E2F-delta24-hTNFα-IRES-hIL2).  The first trial will take place in Europe and address metastatic melanoma in combination with TILs.  Additional trials in other solid tumor indications are planned in combination with a checkpoint modulator and a CAR-T product.

Timegate principle: Faster than fluorescence

In our technology the Raman spectrum is measured before the fluorescence takes over. A short pulse from the excitation laser causes an equally short Raman pulse to be emitted from the sample. After the fluorescence starts rising the detector gate is closed and the fluorescence cannot enter.

Trashless.io,https://startup100.net/company/trashlessio,"Trashless.io brings you the first-ever app to track household waste! We’re currently beta testing on both mobile platforms.
The app allows you to see the annual amount of waste you create, and to see your recycling percentage. You’ll be able to compare your statistics to national averages and see how you’re doing in comparison.
The app is free and we're currently testing it with Finnish data.

Nationally published waste statistics have two main figures: annual kilograms of waste per person, and total recycling percentage.
Trashless.io is built on the idea that it’s nearly impossible for an individual to estimate their own waste numbers and conclude whether they’re doing a good job or not.  With the app it takes minimal effort to track your waste output and recycling, just estimate the volume of each waste category as you take it out. 
With as little as 14 days of tracking, you can see reliable estimates of your household waste and recycling. Naturally the accuracy increases with longer periods of waste data.",,,,https://trashless.io/,{'facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/trashless.io'},3124088-3,https://www.finder.fi/search?what=3124088-3&type=company

Businesses with a car fleet automate their car washing process with UpSteam.
We take away the hidden costs and any type of hassle with a fixed cleaning time while cars are parked and monthly invoicing. Companies usually save up to 40% of their car wash cost by switching to UpSteam and we do not consider the potential income from making it more effective. No more days when your employee has to clean the company's car on their free time or an employer having to pay salary while employees are actually not working. This is definitely something you should be optimizing by now. Learn more about our offers for businesses from our website or by contacting us directly.

No more wasting hours of looking for a car wash place, driving there, waiting in the queue and waiting for the wash to be made. With UpSteam you can order the car wash where ever you are - at home, at work, in the gym or out shopping. It takes 45 seconds to 1 minute for order through the app and that's all the time you spend on car wash from now on.

VibeCatch,https://startup100.net/company/vibecatch-1,"VibeCatch is an advanced employee engagement platform that utilizes frequent pulse polls and analytics to help companies build better culture and improve their bottom line. It is the only employee engagement tool that leverages the effective Quality of Work Life (QWL) Index, created by professor Marko Kesti, a leading academic specializing in HRM performance.

The QWL Index uses unique job satisfaction metrics that highlight specific areas of improvement within the organization, by pinpointing weak signals and undercurrents that most survey methods fail to detect. Through automated polls collecting relevant feedback, leadership can easily shift focus from measuring job satisfaction to actually improving it.

With the scientifically-backed QWL framework, companies can even link employee engagement to productivity and financial results, giving them the opportunity to find what areas would benefit the most from developmental investments.

✅ Enhanced customer experience: Increased video coverage gives consumers richer product information.

✅ SEO ranking: Consumers stay longer on pages with video, boosting time spent on site and Google hits.

✅ Zero hassle: Videoly is fully automated. We add thousands of videos without any manual work required from users.

✅ Replicate the in-store experience online: Nothing beats actually seeing a product in action.

After Covid there are more and more virtual and hybrid annual general meetings (AGMs).

Our software fulfils this gap. We are not reinventing the wheel. We complement existing video conferencing software by providing things that are required for making the AGM legal.  

When our co-founder and CTO started building the software the idea was to create the easiest to use meeting and voting software and based on our clients feedback we have succeeded in that. 
 
Votech has been developed for companies, all all types of NGOs.  Votech enables the organisation of remote and hybrid meetings, taking into account legal decision-making, in an easy and safe manner.
